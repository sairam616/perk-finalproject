            <h1>Meditation for Beginners</h1>
        </div>
        <p>So you’ve decided to start looking after the health of your mind by meditating. But where to begin? How to get started? What are the basics? How will it feel? What to expect? All perfectly normal questions, and, lucky for you, we’re here with the answers you need to get started.</p><br>
        <p>Meditation is simple to learn and involves some fairly straightforward techniques. Before getting started, let’s take care of a few practicalities and answer some everyday questions.</p>

        <h1 class="head">The experience of meditation</h1>
        <p>When you close your eyes and follow the instructions of your first guided meditation (whether in-person or via a recording), you should expect your mind to be busy, easily distracted, and restless, if not more so. Just because you’ve chosen to sit and meditate doesn’t mean you’ll suddenly experience uninterrupted calm, in the same way you’d never expect to tame a wild horse overnight.</p>
        <p>The process of meditating is straightforward and easy: simply sit and practice. All you have to do is close your eyes, stay focused on your breathing, and let your mind do its thing. This is the one skill where you don’t have to strive to achieve something — just a place of stillness where no effort is required.</p>
        <p>There is no such thing as a good or bad meditation. There is only awareness or non-awareness. The moment you realize you’re lost in thought, that’s awareness, and that’s when you return to the object of focus (usually the breath). This is all you have to keep doing — return from your distracted thought to the breath, all the time honing your awareness. With perseverance, the periods between awareness and distraction will get longer and longer.</p>
        <div class="head">
            <h1>What to Wear</h1>
            <p class="right">Wear whatever you like. The most important thing is that you are comfortable and relaxed. If you happen to be wearing a tie, belt, or scarf, you may want to loosen it beforehand and also kick off any uncomfortable, tight-fitting shoes or heels. If you so choose, you could also wear absolutely nothing at all (as long as you’re in the privacy and comfort of your own home).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>How to sit</h1>
            <p>You can meditate inside or outside and can sit on the floor, a cushion, bench, chair, or anything else that works for you. Unless you wish to do so, you can safely forget stereotypical images of sitting cross-legged by a tree. Beginners often find it’s easier to use an upright chair as they’re familiarizing themselves with the practice. Sitting toward the front of the chair will help with the correct posture: back straight, neck relaxed, chin slightly tucked in. Rest your hands loosely on your lap or knees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="head" id="last">
            <h1>Take it day by day</h1>
            <p>Meditation is a journey of a lifetime, not a sprint to instant progress. Take it session by session, day by day, appreciating that this is a skill that requires commitment, patience, and practice, where the benefits are felt gradually over time. There is no “good” or “bad” meditation, and there is no “succeeding” or “failing”; there is only awareness and non-awareness or distraction and non-distraction. Over time, the more the mind learns to become less distracted and the more our awareness stabilizes.</p>
